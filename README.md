# FAQ
Q: Will there be other language translations? 

    A: None planned unfortunately

Q: What version(s) of Python does this run on?

    A: I haven't done testing, but it should work on 3.7+? I'm running on 3.10, so versions close to that should be fine. 2.X will not function.

Q: Are there plans to make this portable (i.e. an executable & GUI)?

    A: Yes! This is very high on my to-do.
